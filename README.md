## Background
In this exercise, several classifier models, such as SVM, decision tree, and logistic regression, are applied to predict sentiment of reviews.<br/>IMDB dataset having 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics. We use a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing.

## Conclusion
* Logistic Regression successfully achieve 82% F1 score. 
* Adjusting models' paramters by GridSearchCV, F1 score does not have significant improvement (opt).
* Further clean text by using stop word method keeps F1 score (Cln).
* We suspect it is resulted from bag-of-words method (One-hot encoding).
* One-hot encoding would cause curse of dimensionality and sparse vectors.
